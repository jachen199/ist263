        Jackie Chen

        I am a computer science major interested in developing software that can assist people in their everyday lives to make it easier. 
        A project that I am proud of includes a Discord bot that I created last semester that allows users to encrypt messages privately and relay the cipher text to other users. Other users can then decrypt those messages using various ciphers that I implemented. A link to the GitHub for that bot can be found here: https://github.com/jachen199/Discryption 
        Outside of school, some hobbies I have include biking, cooking, and playing video games. My favorite TV show is White Collar. I was born and raised in New York City and have three sisters.
