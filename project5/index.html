            There are a ton of stuff you can do in New York City, whether you are only staying a night, a few days, or a week or longer. I have provided a list of the popular places you can visit, places you can get a quick bite, and activities you can do.

        Here are a few places you can visit for some of the great views the city has to offer:

                <div>
                    Having been here many times in my life, this is a great place to go and visit the only place in the city that has as trees in such density. It is a great place to see the surrounding city as well, since it is located near the center of Manhattan. As such, this would be a great first place to visit.

                    Requiring the ferry to get here, it is well worth it. The Statue of Liberty is definitely one of the largest statues in the world, being around 152 feet tall. You are able to see lower Manhattan from this remote island as well.

                    One of the taller buildings in NYC, you can make reservations to see the city from the 102nd floor of the building. The views are breath-taking and seeing pictures does not do this justice.

                    The Twin Towers that were destroyed on 9/11/01 have been replaced with two large pools that have the names of everybody that was killed on that day, engraved into the plaques. I have visited this place very year since it was built, and the beauty of the endless waterfall into the pool is a sight to see.

                <div>
                    Last but not least, this is one of the most popular sights to see. At midnight for New Years, you can watch the well known ball drop in Times Square with your own eyes. This is a great thing to see once in person because of the weather at this time of the year, but is something everyone should experience once. The views on television do a great job at filming this event if you are not up for the task, however.
